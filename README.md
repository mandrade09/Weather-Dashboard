# Weather-Dashboard


## Server-Side APIs: Week 6 Challenge

## Summary of Task
This week my Challenge was to build a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

**Note:** 

I used the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities.  I used the following base URL: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={APIkey}`. I also used `localStorage` to store persistent data. 

Below are the following Challenge requirements according to the 
**User Story** & **Acceptance Criteria**

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```


## Deploying to GitHub Pages
Along with the above requirements, I created this project and deployed it to GitHub Pages. This included creating a new repository, cloning it to my computer, and using git commands to save and push my code to the GitHub repository. 

Hope you enjoyed the weather forecast!
